Playground with xmpt-v3, 

Currently I can't create XMTP client. The console show this error message.

From the terminal console:
```sh
The file does not exist at "/home/kevin/apps/xmtp-v3/node_modules/.vite/deps/workers/client?worker_file&type=module" which is in the optimize deps directory. The dependency might be incompatible with the dep optimizer. Try adding it to `optimizeDeps.exclude`.
```

# Getting started
```
bun install
bun dev
```
